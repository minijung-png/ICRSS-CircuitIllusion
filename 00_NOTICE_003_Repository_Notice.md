Hello, this is Sensory Architect JM, the lead researcher of this project.

In the early stages, I shared some of the research materials a bit hastily in order to begin open experimentation as soon as possible.
As a result, several documents were uploaded in an unrefined form, and various conceptual trials were also conducted to shape the core direction of this work.

Despite that, I sincerely thank everyone who has visited and shown interest in this repository during this formative phase.

We are now approaching the official release of the first paper on ICRSS.
Ahead of this publication, I’ve taken the time to improve and reorganize the repository contents.
Many new research materials will be uploaded soon.

Thank you for your interest and support.

— Sensory Architect JM
