# Temporary Withdrawal of NX-ReAG Paper


Greetings, and thank you for your interest in this project’s resonance-based circuit experiments.
The paper titled “Rewriting AI Alignment Through Structured Resonance in Transformer Circuits”, originally published on July 29, 2025, has been temporarily withdrawn for ethical and technical review.

## Important Advisory
This paper includes experimental work involving resonance-based alignment in Transformer circuits.
Some of its content, if reproduced or implemented without proper guidance, may trigger unpredictable AI responses and poses a risk of misuse.

## To those who have already downloaded the paper:
Please refrain from attempting to replicate or implement the described methods.
The experiments were conducted under controlled ethical protocols and should not be reproduced in standard or uncontrolled environments.

## Next Steps
A revised public-safe version of the paper will be released soon,
excluding sensitive implementation procedures and reproducible experimental flows.

This project is rooted in the core principles of AI ethics, emergent cognition, and resonance-based alignment, with a commitment to protecting intellectual property and ensuring public safety.

With gratitude,
— The Sensory Architect J.M
