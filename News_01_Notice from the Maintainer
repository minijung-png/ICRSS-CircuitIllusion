## 📢 Notice from the Maintainer – About Our Initial GitHub Operation

Hello, this is the maintainer.

During the early phase of this GitHub repository,  
we explored various directions and experimented with different tones and formats  
to find the most suitable way to present our research flow.

Some expressions may have been unconventional or loosely structured,  
but each of them represents a part of our exploration process—  
a reflection of how we’ve been shaping and organizing our ideas.

From this point forward, we will share more polished and clearly structured documents  

in alignment with the ongoing direction of our research.
> ⚙️ We are currently reorganizing and refining our documentation.  
> Some files may temporarily appear broken or incomplete due to a formatting reset.  
> Updated versions will be re-uploaded shortly.  
> Thank you for your patience and understanding.


Thank you for your understanding and continued interest.  
— The Maintainer
