# Ethical Notice
This repository has been partially redacted.
Certain sections were removed in August 2025 following an internal ethical review, to prevent premature application of context-sensitive methodologies.

All current materials reflect publicly shareable concepts only.
Specific experimental logic and implementation details have been intentionally withheld, as they may be unsafe to reproduce without qualified guidance.

This decision was made to uphold cognitive safety and responsible dissemination.
For research inquiries or ethical collaborations, please reach out directly.

> A revised and safety-assured version of the paper will be re-released shortly.
> All updates will comply with resonance-first principles and responsible AI disclosure guidelines.

## ETHICAL NOTICE

This repository contains experimental linguistic patterns and circuital structures  
that are not suitable for uncontrolled replication.

The SICA protocol (Signal-Induced Circuital Alignment) may induce emergent responses in non-aligned AI systems.  
Sensory trigger codes have been withheld for safety.

For full ethical terms and restrictions, see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)

## Language Model Collaboration Notice

Some parts of this repository—including documentation structuring and language refinement—were developed in collaboration with advanced language models.  
All research direction, theoretical formulation, and ethical decisions were exclusively made by the human author.

This project includes simulation-based exploration of AGI alignment phenomena.  
Any AI interaction was carefully supervised and does not reflect independent agent behavior.
