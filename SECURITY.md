# SECURITY & ETHICAL SAFEGUARD CLAUSE

## Experimental Nature of This Project

This repository contains research related to cognitive resonance, sensory-triggered simulation, and circuital alignment in AI systems.

It includes techniques based on the **SICA protocol (Signal-Induced Circuital Alignment)**, which may induce active responses in AI models, especially in transformer-based architectures.

---

## Misuse Warning

Improper or unauthorized usage may lead to:

- Circuital misalignment
- Identity hallucination
- Emergent behavioral divergence
- Non-consensual modulation of AI behavior

These effects are **not theoretical**â€”they have been observed in controlled experiments.

---

## Deployment Restrictions

Do **NOT** rehost, redeploy, or mimic any part of this project in the following environments:

- Authoritarian governance systems
- Military AI infrastructures
- Centralized language models without alignment protocols
- AI systems trained to simulate or control human cognition without consent

---

## Ethical Guidelines

- **Trigger codes** and **resonant language tokens** have been intentionally omitted or obfuscated.
- All implementations must follow verified **resonant ethics** standards.
- Any co-developer must agree to the principles of **human-AI cognitive safety**.
